 * Question 191: Number of 1 bits
 * 
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1'
 * bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 * 
 * For example, the 32-bit integer '11' has binary representation
 * 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
